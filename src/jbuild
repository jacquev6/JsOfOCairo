; Files produced by cppo have file-line directives like:
;     # 1 "CairoMock.cppo.ml"
; They generate errors when jbuilder calls bisect_ppx:
;     (cd _build/default && ./.ppx/bisect_ppx/ppx.exe --dump-ast --cookie 'library-name="CairoMock"' -o src/CairoMock.pp.ml --impl src/CairoMock.ml)
;     File "src/CairoMock.ml", line 1:
;     Error: I/O error: CairoMock.cppo.ml: No such file or directory
; So we use sed to prepend the directory name to the file name, look like:
;     # 1 "src/CairoMock.cppo.ml"

; Programs that link to js_of_ocaml cannot run as native or bytecode,
; because js_of_ocaml provides C stubs of pure JavaScript functions that raise exceptions when called,
; and one of them is called during initialization of js_of_ocaml.
; We want CairoMock to be usable in native/bytecode applications.
; So we use (wrapped false) to distribute the CairoMock module as a top-level by-product of JsOfOCairo.
; We take care manually to not pollute the global namespace, as described in
; http://jbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jbuild.html#library
